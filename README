Introduction
------------

This is a basic (and not physically accurate) simulator for logic gates, written when I was bored during a lecture.

Features:
- Unit testing support, with timeouts and completion conditions.
- printf like state display
- Link usage sanity checks (nodes that are not read/set are noted at runtime)
- Simluation breakpoints
- Preprocessing using the `yasm` preprocessor (requires yasm to be installed)
- Saving/loading of a compiled mesh from disk
- File-backed "ROM" elements

TODO:
- stdio/socket based circuit input and output
- UART element?


CPU-32
------

A "side" project that's become the primary use for this code - a CISC CPU design created for learning purposes.
