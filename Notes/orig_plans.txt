Timestepped

Components interlinked by virtual wires with a one timeslice delay

Component List:
- Fixed Value: Constants (1 and 0), Button, Switch
- Gates: AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, NXOR, NOT
- Output: OUTPUT, 7SEGLCD, LED

Input from a composite file

[$<label>[,$<label>[,...] = ]<operation>,[<operation>[,...]]
OR
[@label = ]<operation>,[<operation>[,...]]
- Each operation can return 0 or more values that are stored into the
  label list (or the list variable)

List variables act as groups of comma separated values

An array can be indexed by "@label[<index>]" to get a single value
 or by "@label[<start>-<stop>]" to get a range

Converted internally into a component list and links

Hence, a "variable" does not have a linear sequence of values, and the
 order of statements in a circuit file does not matter.


=== BUILTIN MODULES ===
-- Trivial/Atomic Gates --
AND - Logical AND of 2+ lines
XOR - Logical XOR of 2+ lines
OR - Logical OR of 2+ lines
NAND - Logical AND of 2+ lines
NOR - Logical NOR of 2+ lines
NXOR - Logical XOR of 2+ lines

-- Timing Helpers --
DELAY - Delay signal(s) for a cycle
DELAY{n} - Delay signal(s) for n cycles
PULSE - Hold output high for 1 cycle when input becomes high

-- Speed helpers (could be implemented using #defunit, but cbf)
DEMUX4 - 4 to 16 demuxer
COUNTER4 - 4 bit counter
