== High Level ==
'#defunit' units maintained within memory (not merged into main blob)
Upon instantiation (pre-execute) build up list of sub-instances
- E.g. a CS Adder would contain three Ripple Adders, which each contain 'n' full adders
Create full mesh just before execution
- Should help maintain a single level of indirection

Simulation pass iterates through all instances in the simulation two/three times
- First to prepare values

## CreateMesh - Takes root definition and returns a flattened definition?
- Give links a reference to original definition?
- Name/instance number?
